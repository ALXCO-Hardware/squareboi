Squareboi is an open hardware cartridge system for the Game Boy Color, made to be as accessible and DIY-friendly as possible.
Using a handful of off-the-shelf components, it provides the same functionality as an original cartridge, compatible with the majority of programs.
Additionally, an Arduino-based programmer allows for easy transfer of games and save data.
 

## Features

Up to 4MB ROM/32KB RAM storage space

Stores save data without needing a battery

Made of common, off-the-shelf parts

Programmer works as a general purpose cartridge reader

Easy to build: A basic version can be made with entirely through-hole components

Powered by a single 5V rail


## Manual

A thorough explanation of how the system works, and how to assemble it, can be found in the manual file, [HERE.](/Manual.pdf)


## Acknowledgements

Squareboi's existence is only possible due to the continued efforts of multiple individuals dedicated to reverse engineering and documenting the Game Boy hardware.
A full list of those whose work I've built upon can be found within the manual.

Still, I'd like to say it again: Thanks to all of you! I wouldn't have gotten here alone.
